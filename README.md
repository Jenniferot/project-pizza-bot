# Pizza Bot

This project was to build a Pizza Bot. The focus was to practice the JavaScript parts, but also to hook it up with the HTML. We used pair-programming and worked in pairs.

## The problem

You could choose between three different pizzas, how many you would like to order and the bot would tell you the total cost. There were some problems with the functions, but after debugging we solved the problems. We commented out some code and made sure of which parts were working using console.log. 

If we had more time we would make a ux-friendly website with imagesand more css.
